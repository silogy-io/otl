# Automatically re-running failed tests

smelt allows for end users to automatically re-run failing tests

# Re-run API

After every smelt test list execution, each executed target and it's return code will be passed to a `RerunCallback`, and must return a new `Target`, and a `bool` -- the returned `Target` should have some "injected state" in order to create a new command, and the bool should be true if this specific target needs to be re-executed. In code, this callback is

```python
RerunCallback = Callable[[Target, int], Tuple[Target, bool]]
```

By default, the rerun callback provided by smelt is

```python
def default_target_rerun_callback(
    target: Target, return_code: int
) -> Tuple[Target, bool]:
    """
    # Only explicitly re-run failing tests
    requires_rerun = target.rule_type() == SmeltTargetType.Test and return_code != 0
    new_target = deepcopy(target)
    # create a new target with the same name and _rerun appended
    new_target.name = f"{new_target.name}_rerun"
    # also we inject {'debug': True}
    new_target.injected_state = {"debug": "True"}
    return (new_target, requires_rerun)
```

# Re-run internals

To impliment re-running, smelt does the following in sequence:

- calls the re-run callback on every executed target
- inspect each generated target, and see if it has "changed" from the original target. a target has changed if:
  - it needs to be rerun
  - the command contents has changed and it does not need to be re-run (for example, when a if we want to have a debug build
  - A dependency of the target has changed
- for each target that has changed, we generate a new command -- the new command will have it's dependencies adjusted to it depends on any new commands that have been generated
- if any of the newly generated commands need to be executed, we submit all of the newly generated commands to the graph, and we execute them.

This allows us to handle a few interesting cases

## Example graph -- re-running without rebuilding

Lets say we have two tests that depdend on a build

    ┌──────────────┐
    │ BUILD        │──────────────────┐
    └──┬───────────┘                  │
       ▼                              ▼
    ┌──────────────┐            ┌──────────────┐
    │ TEST1        │            │ TEST2        │
    └──────────────┘            └──────────────┘

To re-run these tests -- we don't need to rebuild, and we don't want to rebuild (that takes time, resources)

so after we go through our steps, the entire graph looks like

    ┌──────────────┐
    │ BUILD        │──────────────────┬─────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐
    └──┬───────────┘                  │                     │                      │
       ▼                              ▼                     ▼                      ▼
    ┌──────────────┐            ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐  ┌────────────────────┐
    │ TEST1        │            │ TEST2        │    │TEST1_RERUN       │  │TEST2_RERUN         │
    └──────────────┘            └──────────────┘    └──────────────────┘  └────────────────────┘

and we only tell smelt to execute `TEST1_RERUN` and `TEST2_RERUN`

## Example graph -- re-running with rebuilding

Now we have a similar situation -- two tests, but to rerun our tests, we need to rebuild. For clarity, the same graph, repeated

    ┌──────────────┐
    │ BUILD        │──────────────────┐
    └──┬───────────┘                  │
       ▼                              ▼
    ┌──────────────┐            ┌──────────────┐
    │ TEST1        │            │ TEST2        │
    └──────────────┘            └──────────────┘

so after we go through our steps, we need to have a build rerun command, and we create it

    ┌──────────────┐                                          ┌──────────────────┐
    │ BUILD        │──────────────────┐                     ┌─┤BUILD_RERUN       ├─┐
    └──┬───────────┘                  │                     │ └──────────────────┘ │
       ▼                              ▼                     ▼                      ▼
    ┌──────────────┐            ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐  ┌────────────────────┐
    │ TEST1        │            │ TEST2        │    │TEST1_RERUN       │  │TEST2_RERUN         │
    └──────────────┘            └──────────────┘    └──────────────────┘  └────────────────────┘

and we only tell smelt to execute `TEST1_RERUN` and `TEST2_RERUN`, and when we do this, BUILD_RERUN is first executed by the smelt execution engine.

In both scenarios, we try to create a `BUILD_RERUN` target -- but in the first scenario, when we try to create `BUILD_RERUN` target, we see that nothing has changed between the prospecitve `BUILD_RERUN` target and the original `BUILD` target, so we fallback to the original
