OTL is a task and test runner that aims to be a simple framework to declare, execute and analyze tests; OTL was designed specifically designed to make the testing of digital circuits easy.

Once [installed](/installation), you just need to describe your tasks
using a simple [YAML][yaml] schema in a file called `test.otl`:

```yaml title="test.otl"
version: "3"

- name: say_hey
  rule: raw_bash
  rule_args:
    cmds:
      - echo "hey"
```

And call it by running `otl-cli execute test.otl` from your terminal.

## Features

- [Gradual adoption](/adoption): Gradually move your tests and build into OTL
- [Extensible](/writing-rules): Define your tests with a simple python interface
- [Programatic test generation](/python-api): Programatically generate tests with python!Spin up 1000s of tests with 10 lines of code
- [Run anywhere](/runners): Launch tests locally, in the cloud, dispatch them to SLURM or LSF.
